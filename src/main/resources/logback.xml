    defaults and add custom logger levels you can copy this file and add additional
    overrides, e.g:

    <include resource="org/springframework/boot/logging/logback/base.xml"/>
    <logger name="org.springframework.web" level="DEBUG"/>
    ...

    <include resource="org/springframework/boot/logging/logback/base.xml"/>
    <!-- uncomment to see trace of communication between SDK and services -->
    <!-- <logger name="com.intuit" level="DEBUG"/> -->
